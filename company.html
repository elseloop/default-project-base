        <p><strong>Omlet Chat is just one of many apps that are being &ldquo;hatched&rdquo; by MobiSocial, a startup in incubation at the Stanford StartX program. Stay tuned: we are formally launching in the first quarter of 2014.</strong></p>
        <p> Led by serial entrepreneur Monica Lam &ndash; a professor in the Computer Sciences Department at Stanford University &ndash; and her team of PhD students, MobiSocial is the team behind the development of the Omlet Open Messaging Platform, a new standard for mobile messaging applications that leverages the unique attributes of the phone to enable consumers to &ldquo;share anything, with anyone, anywhere,&rdquo; while owning the data they share. With an official launch date in Q1 2014 &ndash; where MobiSocial will unveil a number of innovations &ndash; MobiSocial is working closely with a wide range of device manufacturers, telecommunication carriers, and consumer data storage vendors that are looking to define and evolve the new Open Messaging marketplace.</p>
        <h3>Social Sharing Reinvented with Omlet</h3>
        <p>If you were at CES (Consumer Electronics Show) on January 6, perhaps you heard the buzz. The first application to be hatched on the Omlet Open Messaging Platform&mdash;a new standard for messaging&mdash;Omlet Chat is an over-the-top (OOT) messaging app that enables consumers to share anything (text, images, files, video, music), with anyone, from any device (IOS or Android). One of the key features of Omlet Chat is the ability for groups to find, connect, and collaborate with one another (for example, creating &ldquo;social galleries&rdquo; of their photos) regardless of what other networks they belong to. By leveraging the power of the phone and its social DNA, Omlet Chat will introduce the new &ldquo;Open Messaging&rdquo; experience to the global marketplace. ASUS is embedding Omlet Chat as a native app on all units of ZenFone, the revolutionary new phone that it unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on January 6, 2014. But you can download the app today on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omlet/id682042134?ls=1&mt=8">the App Store</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobisocial.omlet">Google Play</a>.</p>

                <p>With Omlet Chat, friends at a football game can connect together with a Social Hotspot. They can have a fun conversation, competing on how they can enhance the game, for example,  with a &ldquo;heart on the big screen display&rdquo;. Even people outside the stadium can participate in the competition, in real time. All this is made possible by a drawer of apps &mdash; native or HTML. Animotions shown in the picture are an example of how users can share their own animated expressions &mdash; Gifs &mdash; in a jiffy.</p>
